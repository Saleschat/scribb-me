Everything is in this skill's own folder; paths are relative to this file:
- `references/base/guide.md`: habits that mark machine-written text. Always applies.
- `references/content-types/<id>/`: `guide.md`, `summary.md`, `sample.md`, `formats/<format>.md`, and for UI copy `roles/shadcn.yaml`. Each `pack.yaml` has the tagline and default freedom.
  - `product-docs`: getting started, how-tos, help articles, READMEs and other repo files, release notes. Default freedom strict.
  - `developer-docs`: API, SDK and CLI reference, integration guides. Strict.
  - `ux-microcopy`: interface strings such as buttons, dialogs, errors, empty states, toasts. Strict.
  - `newsletter`: newsletter issues, product updates, welcome emails. Balanced.
- `references/styles/<id>/`: optional voices. Use one only when the user names it. On a conflict, the content type wins.
